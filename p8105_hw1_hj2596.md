#Calculate the mean flipper length
mean_of_flipper_length = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm=TRUE)
```

Description: The dataset contains the information on three species of
penguins from three islands. Each row(observation) is a penguin and
there are eight columns containing the information of penguins including
species, the island they are from, bill length (in mm), bill depth (in
mm), flipper length (in mm), body mass (in g), sex and year for each
penguin observation. There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the penguins
dataset. The mean of flipper length is 200.9152047mms after removing the
missing values.

``` r
#Creating the scatterplot with ggplot
ggplot(penguins,aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species))+ geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

```

    ## [1] NA

The mean can be calculated for the number vector(the normal sample of
size 10) and the logical vector. But the mean cannot be calculated for
the character vector and the factor vector and the result is N/A for the
character vector and the factor vector.

``` r
#use as.numeric to create three new vector from the three vectors above
#and try to calculate the mean value of them
numeric_logical_vector = as.numeric((pull(problem2_df,norm_samp_pos)))
mean(numeric_logical_vector)
numeric_char_vector = as.numeric((pull(problem2_df,char_vec)))
mean(numeric_char_vector)
numeric_factor_vector =as.numeric((pull(problem2_df,factor_vec)))
mean(numeric_factor_vector)
```

The values of logical factor are converted to numbers 1 and 0, since the
value of TRUE is 1 and the value of FALSE is 0 in R programming. The
values factor vector are converted to numbers of 1, 2 and 3. But the
character vector cannot be converted to numbers. Yes, this explained why
we can calculate the mean of the logical vector in the question above
since TRUE and FALSE have values of 1 and 0. And we cannot calculate the
mean for the factor vector unless it is converted to number using
as.numeric. And for the character vector, it cannot be converted to
numbers because here they are letters instead of numbers in the
character vector.
