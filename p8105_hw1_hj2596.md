    ## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g

``` r
#Get the nrow and ncol
penguins_row = nrow(penguins)
penguins_col = ncol(penguins)
#Calculate the mean flipper length
mean_of_flipper_length = mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm=TRUE)
```

Description: The dataset contains the information on penguins. Each
row(observation) is a penguin and there are eight columns containing the
information of penguins including species, the island they are from,
bill length (in mm), bill depth (in mm), flipper length (in mm), body
mass (in g), sex and year for each penguin observation. There are 344
rows and 8 columns in the penguins dataset. The mean of flipper length
is 200.9152047mms after removing the missing values.

``` r
#Creating the scatterplot with ggplot
ggplot(penguins,aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species))+ geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

# Problem Two

``` r
#create the dataframe for problem 2
problem2_df = tibble(
  #create the normal sample
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  #create the logical vector
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  #create the character vector
  char_vec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  #create the factor vector
  factor_vec = factor(c("high","medium","low","high","medium","low","high","medium","low","high"))
)
```

``` r
#calculate mean for the normal sample of size 10
mean_vector1 = mean(pull(problem2_df,norm_samp))
mean_vector1
```

    ## [1] 0.5131305

``` r
#calculate mean for the logical vector
mean_vector2 = mean(pull(problem2_df,norm_samp_pos))
mean_vector2
```

    ## [1] 0.8

``` r
#calculate mean for the character vector
mean_vector3 = mean(pull(problem2_df,char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vector3
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
#calculate mean for the factor vector
mean_vector4 = mean(pull(problem2_df,factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_vector4
```

    ## [1] NA

The mean can be calculated for the number vector(the normal sample of
size 10) and the logical vector but the mean cannot be calculated for
the character vector and the factor vector.

``` r
numeric_logical_vector = as.numeric((pull(problem2_df,norm_samp_pos)))
mean(numeric_logical_vector)
numeric_char_vector = as.numeric((pull(problem2_df,char_vec)))
mean(numeric_char_vector)
numeric_factor_vector =as.numeric((pull(problem2_df,factor_vec)))
mean(numeric_factor_vector)
```

The values of logical factor are converted to numbers 1 and 0, since the
value of TRUE is 1 and the value of FALSE is 0 before converting. The
values factor vector are converted to numbers of 1, 2 and 3. But the
character vector can not be converted to numbers. Yes, this explained
why we can calculate the mean of the logical vector in the question
above. We can calculate the mean for it because TRUE and FALSE are
treated as 1 and 0. And we cannot calculate the mean for factor unless
it is converted to number. And for the character vector, it cannot be
converted to numbers because they are letters, but if they were numbers
in the character vector, it can also be converted.
